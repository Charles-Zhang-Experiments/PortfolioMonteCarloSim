TODO: 

* We need to migrate proper to nginx.
* Redo analysis and screenshots
* Rebuld and republish
* (Core) Add currency ETL terms into final visualization

Done:
* Add risk exposure in parathesis in report.
* (Issue) Why the hell the front end is not automatically adjusting column on mobile? And it causes error when summoning nav menu. The website is down now.
* (Issue) It doesn't make shit sense even in the worst case SPY is still positive gain? Besides, SPY is correlated with the other one. The underlying cause might be an error we made with initial asset allocation - it's multiplied again with interest rate.
